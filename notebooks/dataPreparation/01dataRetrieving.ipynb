    "How should we select wich data feed is relevant ? That is the question we firstly asked ourselves. As the specifications notice it, our final goal is to \"understand and simulate the evolution of the SST parameter in time, study the stability of the model and evaluate its capacity to reproduce or predict observed fluctuations\". The success of this mission therefore depends first and foremost on the quality of the data on which we base our work. Based on this reasoning, we decided to download and compare two similar products from the following feeds: NOAA and Copernicus Marine."

    "### How did we select the following products?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we focused on Level 4 (L4) products. The term “Lx” refers to the processing level of a dataset. L4 corresponds to a highly processed data product, in which multiple observation sources are combined, and optimal interpolation techniques are applied to fill data gaps (OI marker in the name of the product for NOAA). Additional corrections and quality controls may also be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, L4 products provide spatially and temporally complete gridded fields, with no missing values and reduced inconsistencies. Since our objective is to model, predict, and quantitatively compare ocean surface temperature datasets, we consider L4 products to be the most appropriate choice for this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we mainly focus on SST parameter(Sea Surface Temperature) for the moment, so we select SST marked product."
